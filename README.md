## What is SpECTRE?

SpECTRE is an open-source code for multi-scale, multi-physics problems in
astrophysics and gravitational physics. It is based on high-order spectral
finite element methods and massive parallelism. In the future, we hope that
it can be applied to problems across discipline boundaries in fluid
dynamics, geoscience, plasma physics, nuclear physics, and
engineering. It runs at petascale and is designed for future exascale
computers.

SpECTRE is being developed in support of our collaborative Simulating
eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) research program into the multi-messenger
astrophysics of black hole and neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae,
and gamma-ray bursts.
